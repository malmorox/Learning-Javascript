# Learning-Javascript
These are my first steps in Javascript.

Years ago I studied basic HTML and CSS in classes, but I wanted to see more advanced things on my own. It got to a point where I already hit the ceiling and had to make the move to Javascript. I will learn this course 2023/24 in class, but I am already starting with YouTube tutorials.
